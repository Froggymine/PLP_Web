      <div class="goalSplitBody">
        My first goal, which is my learning goal, is to complete 3 programming projects and learn the required skills to complete them. While these projects are not individually defined, they would be ones that would push and stretch my skills to the edge and challenge me. This would help me futher and learn new skills in programming, which is both useful as I enjoy programming, but my future job will primarily require it.
