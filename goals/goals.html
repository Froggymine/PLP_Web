        Blender is a 3d creative software. It is a complete suit of tools capable of doing almost anything related to 3d art. I have used blender for a while but have never approached creating a person, due to the investment of time and effort to create even one’s first character. However, it is an incredibly useful skill, and with learning it, many other skills will both be learnt and improved. I already know about creating characters and a have little bit of skill with sculpting organics so I’m not starting from zero. I am not looking to create a perfect character at all during this time, just my first one. From there, in the future, I can continue making characters and furthering my skills using the knowledge I’ve gained from learning how to create my first character. I will complete by the semester.

        TryHackMe is a site to learn pentesting and hacking, in regards to both hobbyists and career focused people. It teaches the skills from the bottom up on all areas of hacking, from the more stereotypical things such as infiltrating servers to things such as stenography and cryptography. It does this through “rooms”, that contain sets of questions. These questions can both be things related to research or processing the information you’ve just read, to giving some info from the practical task you complete. There are various “paths”, which are structured groups and orders of rooms to complete in order to learn skills in an order. I would be completing the beginner path in order to gain the fundamental skills and knowledge to be able to continue in other areas. I will complete by the semester.
