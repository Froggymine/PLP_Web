      <div class="goalSplitBody">
        As I inevitably get stuck at points, I will try to do research and get help from the internet. However, that doesn’t always get me past my issue. Thus, I can turn to various people I know, who are knowledgeable in regard to programming and computers, such as my dad. Even if they can’t directly help with my specific problem, they can help guide me to a solution.

        Help from peers
      </div>
      <div class="goalSplitBody">
        A writeup is a text where someone who has completed, in this case, one of the tryhackme boxes, writes on their process and what they did. These are both good tools to get help with completing a current one when stuck, but also to look at after completion to compare how I went with them, and what was different in how we solved the problems.
