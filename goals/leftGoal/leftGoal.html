        Youtube has a wealth of tutorials, and a lot of character creation in blender. Many of the tutorials are high quality and are made by professionals in the industry. They can cover both top to bottom on how to create a character, to an in depth tutorial on one part of the process. Using this, I can fully learn the process, without having to pay for a course or tutor. In addition, it means I can complete the project in my own time.

      <div class="goalSplitBody">
          Taking breaks every 30-45 minutes helps maintain both physical and mental health, and working effectiveness. Breaks should generally be getting away from the computer and getting some sunshine and fresh air. Allowing your eyes to look around and away from the screen both helps with their health but also means you can sustain work for longer, without your eyes becoming in pain. In addition, drinking water regularly is extremely important to maintain health.
